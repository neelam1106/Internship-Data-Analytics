**Project Name:** Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning
**Duration:** 09 Sep 2025 â€“ 16 Sep 2025
**Hours:** 18

**Description:**
This project applied supervised machine learning techniques to predict target variables based on structured datasets. The analysis included regression modeling, feature selection, and model evaluation.

**Objectives:**

* Perform feature selection and check multicollinearity
* Train baseline regression models
* Apply log transformation to target variable for improved accuracy
* Test Ridge and Lasso regression models
* Evaluate model performance and residuals

**Tools & Technologies:**

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas / NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

**Tasks Completed:**

1. Selected relevant features and checked multicollinearity
2. Trained baseline Linear Regression model
3. Encoded categorical variables
4. Applied Ridge and Lasso regression with cross-validation
5. Analyzed residuals and model coefficients
6. Tested single prediction utility and documented findings
