DESCRIPTION: The objective of this task was to perform  data analysis and visualization using Power BI. The goal was to demonstrate the ability to present business 
insights clearly through an interactive dashboard. For this task, I chose Power BI because it provides powerful visualization tools, interactive filters,
and the ability to handle large datasets effectively.

I worked on a real-world retail sales dataset containing information such as sales amount, units sold, operating profit, regions, beverage brands, retailers,
and monthly trends. I started by importing the dataset into Power BI, then created key performance indicators (KPIs) for Total Sales, Total Units Sold,
Operating Profit, and Average Operating Profit. I also built visualizations like bar charts for monthly trends, donut charts for brand-wise distribution, and
treemaps for sales by state and city.

For interactivity, I added filters for Region, Retailer, Beverage Brand, Quarter, and Month, allowing dynamic analysis. I worked on organizing the layout and applied
a blue theme for visual appeal. The final output is a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that presents key metrics and trends in an easy-to-understand way.
This task helped me understand how to turn raw business data into meaningful insights through visualization
