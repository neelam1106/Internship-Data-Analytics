DESCRIPTION: The objective of task 1 was to perfoem Big Data Analysis using tools like PyPark or Dash.
The goal was to demonstrate the ability to handle the large datasets effectively.Foe this task i have choosed
PySpark because it is designed for handling big data and works well cloud platform like Google cloud.
I worked on a real-world fraud detection dataset that had over 20,000+ rows and 113 columns.Many columns 
contained only zero values,so I cleaned the dataset by removing them using PySpark functions.I also renamed the 
colunm names to make the analysing process earier.

For this task, I used Google Colab as my coding platform, along with Python and PySpark for data analysis. 
I also practiced uploading large files,renaming columns,and extracting insights using PySpark DataFrame methods.
To complete this task,I worked regularly from Monday to Saturday from 4 PM to 7 PM and one extended session on Tuesday till 8 PM. 
I spent time learning PySpark basics ,google colab platform,running code,cleaning data ,and documenting insights.
The final output is a Google Colab notebook with all the code and a summary of key findings,which I uploaded to GitHub.

This task hepled me understanding how data analytics thinks and also how to handle the datasets to draw useful
and meaningful insights.

Output:
