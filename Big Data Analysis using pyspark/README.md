## **4 README â€“ Data Analysis using PySpark**

**Project Name:** Data Analysis using PySpark


**Description:**
This project involved analyzing structured datasets using PySpark for distributed data processing. The focus was on large-scale aggregations, grouping, and visualization of sales and performance metrics.

**Objectives:**

* Load and preprocess datasets in PySpark
* Perform exploratory data analysis (total sales, units sold)
* Compute groupby aggregations and derived metrics
* Generate visualizations using PySpark DataFrame and Matplotlib

**Tools & Technologies:**

* Python
* PySpark
* Matplotlib / Pandas

**Tasks Completed:**

1. Set up PySpark in Colab and loaded datasets
2. Checked schema, data types, and handled missing values
3. Calculated total sales and units sold using groupby
4. Created visualizations for sales trends and key metrics
5. Validated computations and saved results for dashboards
6. Computed additional derived metrics for dashboard integration
