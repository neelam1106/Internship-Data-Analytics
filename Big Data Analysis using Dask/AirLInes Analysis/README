README â€“ Big Data Analysis using Dask (Airlines)**

**Project Name:** Big Data Analysis using Dask (Airlines)

**Description:**
This project involved analyzing airline datasets using Dask to handle large-scale data efficiently. The analysis focused on daily and weekly flight patterns, cancellations, delays, and correlation among key metrics.

**Objectives:**

* Explore airline data for trends and patterns
* Handle large datasets efficiently with Dask
* Perform EDA: flights per day, cancelled flights, departure/arrival delays
* Create visualizations to present insights

**Tools & Technologies:**

* Python
* Dask
* Matplotlib / HvPlot
* Pandas

**Tasks Completed:**

1. Installed libraries and set up Dask client
2. Loaded datasets, checked schema, partitions, and null values
3. Performed exploratory data analysis (flights/day, cancellations/day)
4. Calculated departure & arrival delays per airline
5. Correlation analysis and persisted datasets
6. Repartitioned datasets and visualized top airports by delays
